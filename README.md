# brickhaus lifestyle: a lifestyle app for nutrition tracking, fitness advice & more.
## WDIR Final Project by Alyssa Kieffer

## Technology
#### For this project, I utilized the MEAN stack - Mongo, Express, AngularJS and Node.

## Methods
#### I began my project by achieving full MEAN CRUD in the most basic way possible. I set up a Controller for the Item (i.e. the food) and went from there. Once this was achieved, I worked on basic styling. I opted for a color palette and header and my inspiration, and kept a sleekly designed wire frame to follow.
