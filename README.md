## WDIR Final Project by Alyssa Kieffer

## Technology
For this project, I utilized the MEAN stack - Mongo, Express, AngularJS and Node.

## Methods
I began my project by achieving full MEAN CRUD in the most basic way possible. I set up a Controller for the Item (i.e. the food) and went from there. Once this was achieved, I worked on basic styling. I opted for a color palette and header and my inspiration, and kept a sleekly designed wire frame to follow.

## Issues

At first, I was having connectivity issues with my Mongo Database and my project itself. Instead of pushing all of the new food nutrient information, it was only generating an ID. I realized that I was connected to the wrong DB within my Mongo tab and was able to resolve the issue with no harm to my code.

Additionally, I really struggled launching to Heroku up until the final night. I was unable to do it on my own, although Terminal showed success with pushing to origin Heroku. Dan was able to resolve the issue with me though. 

## New Material

Since I am very fond of CSS and am keen to finding new ways to utilize it, I opted to learn CSS Grid. It's an alternative way to get div's to line up properly without using flex or float. I got the hang of it quite quickly and am actually planning on integrating this new method into my portfolio as well.
